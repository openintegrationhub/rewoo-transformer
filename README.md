# OIH Transformer for REWOO Scope

The low code platform REWOO Scope can be used to develop software to formalize business processes. 
In order to integrate these individual solutions into the company's IT landscape, the software can be 
coupled to other business software via the OIH using openintegrationhub/rewoo-adapter and openintegrationhub/rewoo-transformer.

In a first step this transformer can be used to transform the REWOO Scope JSON for files to OIH JSON and vice versa.
